Introduce Workspaces,
workspace is a working directory, where all useful files are stored and looked up.

single apiKey may have many workspaces.
When client opens the session, he defines which workspace has to be used.
Workspace offers following directory structure:
 /base_dir/apiKeys/{apiKey}/workspaces/{workspaceGuid}
 ./render        <-- output folder, where the rendered frames are uploaded
 ./scenes        <-- scenes, which can be opened and be used as pre-defined environment with materials and some objects, also render settings
 ./assets        <-- max files which can be used to be merged into scene
 ./maps          <-- textures
 ./xrefs         <-- xref objects that can be imported into scene

 Following commands can be added to web api:
  openScene("sceneFilename.max")
  assignMaterial(someSceneObjectName, someExistingMaterialName)
  merge("assetFilename.max")
  createXref("xrefFilename")

Also may be possible:
 saveScene("sceneFilename.max") // to save generated scene for better understanding
 saveAs(someSceneObjectName, "someFilename.max") // to save some object for future merge operation

Additionally:
 + physically workspaces are shared folders, render nodes can directly access all files for read and write
 + user can GET /workspace and retrieve workspace infos with urls to ftp

 + workspaces are created manually, each apiKey must be provided with some default workspace
 + workspaces are essentially ftp accessible for file download/upload
 + web interface may be also very nice to have, for example http://extplorer.sourceforge.net/

 + when workspace is opened, 3ds max has to adjust directories to direct on ./maps and ./xrefs, so that all resources can be easily found
