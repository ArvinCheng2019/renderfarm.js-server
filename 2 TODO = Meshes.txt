Geometry is a data structure of verts and faces,
when geometry is places in scene, together with transformation matrixes and materials, = it becomes a Mesh.

The only exportable type is BufferGeometry. You must export it as .toJSON() and then compress the string.

BufferGeometry can be post to /scene/0/geometry resource.

The resource is organized with cache. Each session has own geometry cache.
POST will check if BufferGeometry.uuid exists in cache.

Cache item maps the Editable_Mesh node name in 3ds max to the geometry uuid, saving in place the json too.

cacheItem: {
    maxNodeName:      maxNodeName,
    geometryJsonText: geometryJsonText
}

This is needed to avoid multiple copies in 3ds max, so when you post two copies to the scene, it will be resolved into inscaned copy in 3ds max.

TODO: make it possible to post /scene/0/geometry with uuid only, relying on inner resource cache.

TODO: GET on /scene/:sceneid/geometry/:uuid
    Run 3ds max export of the given mesh.
